Explain, using a relevant example, how redis (or a similar) can increase scalability (drastic) for a server using
server side sessions.


When a customer or user logs in, they authenticate and receive a token. This token then allows them to interact
with any server in your web tier - the token is sent each time. There is no need for a "master" server and "slave"
servers, because each server is the same. This allows you to scale horizontally very easily.
The session data is then stored in a fast database like Redis.
