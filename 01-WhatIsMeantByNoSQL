Explain, generally what is meant by a NoSQL database.


A NoSQL database environment is, simply put, a non-relational and largely distributed database system that enables rapid,
ad-hoc organization and analysis of extremely high-volume, disparate data types. NoSQL databases are sometimes referred
to as cloud databases, non-relational databases, Big Data databases and a myriad of other terms and were developed in
response to the sheer volume of data being generated, stored and analyzed by modern users (user-generated data) and
their applications (machine-generated data).

In general, NoSQL databases have become the first alternative to relational databases, with scalability, availability,
and fault tolerance being key deciding factors. They go well beyond the more widely understood legacy, relational
databases (such as Oracle, SQL Server and DB2 databases) in satisfying the needs of today’s modern business
applications. A very flexible and schema-less data model, horizontal scalability, distributed architectures, and the
use of languages and interfaces that are “not only” SQL typically characterize this technology.
