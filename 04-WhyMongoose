Explain reasons to add a layer like Mongoose, on top of a schema-less database like MongoDB.


Mongoose is an ORM-like tool for MongoDB. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model your
application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks and more, out of
the box.
Mongoose adds another layer of robustness on top of MongoDB. Write less code, easier to read code (object modeling)
and schema validation.
MongoDB is schema-less and Mongoose adds schemas. This might seem counterintuitive at first, but real life data often
has structure and types.
