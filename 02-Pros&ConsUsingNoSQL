Explain pros & cons in using a NoSQL database like MongoDB


Pros:

- As a rule of thumb you can find a NoSQL database that fits exactly your specific needs.

- If you're lucky your NoSQL database could be a very simple one in terms of architecture. So you can easily operate it
with your own hands without an expensive DBA, plus you may commit changes to this database code manually.

- It is easier to find a cluster database among NoSQL ones rather than among SQL ones. A cluster database means that
you install it over many machines and it's working across all those machines as if it was the only one machine.


Cons:

- NoSQL databases haven't been around here for so long. They might have some annoying bugs, poor documentation or
unexpected behavior.

- You obviously don't have a universal language like SQL. So be prepared to change completely your app code base as
you're moving towards another NoSQL solution.

- Sometimes it is not easy to find support for a NoSQL DB, even if you're ok to pay for it.
