Explain how databases like MongoDB and Redis would be classified in the NoSQL world.


Overall there are 4 different types of NoSQL databases:
Document stores, Graph stores, Key-value stores and Wide-column stores.

Redis is a Key-value store, and MongoDB is a Document store type database.


- Document databases pair each key with a complex data structure known as a document. Documents can contain many different
key-value pairs, or key-array pairs, or even nested documents.

- Graph stores are used to store information about networks of data, such as social connections. Graph stores include
Neo4J and Giraph.

- Key-value stores are the simplest NoSQL databases. Every single item in the database is stored as an attribute name
(or "key"), together with its value. Examples of key-value stores are Riak and Berkeley DB. Some key-value stores,
such as Redis, allow each value to have a type, such as "integer", which adds functionality.

- Wide-column stores such as Cassandra and HBase are optimized for queries over large datasets, and store columns of data
together, instead of rows.
