Period 3 - NoSQL, MongoDB + Mongoose & Redis

Mikkel Vig

This is my hand-in for the 3. period MEAN JavaScript course. In this project, i have one file for each question,
except for in two cases, where an additional file was necessary.
The additional files are: session.js used for question 8, and user.js witch is used for question 7.
